		<p>
			I'm currenlty a second year studying Computer Science Infrastructure in TUDublin. I'm in Moate in Westmeath so when I don't have accomidation I commute to class.<br>
			I'm the type of person that if I see an oppertunity, I'll go for it and I beleive that my achievements prove this statement.<br>
			I'm a huge dog enthusiast. I've had two dogs so far Brandi - Pomeranian and my rescue Rosie - King Charles.<br>
			I went into Computer Science as I know that I'm a smart person but with the Leaving Cert, I knew that I wouldn't get the points for Mathematics so I went with Computer Science.<br>
			After graduating, I plan on going for a Masters either in Software Engineering or Data Science but I don't fully know yet which I'll go for.<br>
			If I were to describe myself, I would say that I'm a mix between a shy and people person which I know seems contradictory. I'm the type of person that will stick to myself for a while until I feel comfortable.<br>
			After a while, I'll risk it and I'll start to interact with others but I'll only really be myself after being with them for a while.
